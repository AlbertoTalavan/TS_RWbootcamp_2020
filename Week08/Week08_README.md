### Sandwich Saturation.
Sandwich Saturation is an app that shows a list of sandwiches, their names, images, and amount of sauce they have. Our goals are:  
- add data persistence,  
- be able to make a search for a particular sandwich,
- be able to sort the sandwiches, even while filtering using the search bar.
