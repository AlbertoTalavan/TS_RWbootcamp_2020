# Week 10.

### Playground with concurrent animations.
This homework consists in a short playground exercise about **extending UIView to accept a _DispatchGroup_ argument** and show an _Animations Complete!_ message when the animation completes.  
Use **animationGroup** and your new animate function to rewrite the animation, so you are notified when all the sub-animations have finished..
