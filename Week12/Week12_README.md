# Week 12 (Monday 10 August to Sunday 16 August)

## 🎉 Capstone project 🎉

This week there is no homework nor assignments ... is all about our **bootcamp graduation Capstone project**.

It is supposed to be a MVP, so it´s ok if not all functionality is working... because we have **one week** to make it.  

We can create whatever the project we want, it can be: a project that will get to the App Store when completed, something just for
fun, something to experiment with new things... It is up to us! 🥳.

So wait for it with ❤️.



For sure it will be made using:
