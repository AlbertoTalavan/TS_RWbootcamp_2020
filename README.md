**Programming Experience:**  
Along my life I have been working in some different fields (electronics, desktop support, ...), but my background is mostly in networking and security (snoc).
I have done some programming courses along my life in different languajes but I have never worked as a developer before.
Since, more or less, the last year I felt I was tired of not doing the thing I love the most and started my process of changing careers and focus on iOS and Swift...and I still loving it... so here I am taking my habilities as far as I can to achieve my dream job.  

**Goals:**  
Become a great iOS software engineer, and make a living doing the things I love the most! (create new things and try to solve problems).  

**Hoobies / Interests:**  
I love multiple things... some of them are: 
- Programming (I am passionate about that), my dog (Hi there I´m León 🐶),
- Sports, 
- rolling skating, 
- anime, 
- videogames, 
- Action Sci-fi movies, 
- read technical books, 
- TV wild life documentals, 
- and so much more...
