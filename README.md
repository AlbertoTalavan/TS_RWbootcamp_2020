# TS_RWbootcamp_2020 


- **Name:** Alberto Talaván.
- **Discord username:** TS: Alberto Talavan.
- **Basic Location:** SPAIN 🇪🇸 (city: Madrid)
- **Programming Experience:** No job experience as a developer. My background is mostly in network and security (snoc). I have
                           done various programming courses along my life in different languajes but I have never worked as
                           a developer before. Since, more or less, the last year I started to focus only on iOS and Swift due
                           to an introductory course I did.
- **Goals:** Become a professional iOS software engineer, and that way work on the IT field I like the most.
- **Hoobies / Interests:** I love multiple things... some of them are: Programming (of course), my dog (Hi there I´m León 🐶),
                        Sports, rolling skating, anime, videogames, movies, read technical books, documetals... and 
                        so much more.
