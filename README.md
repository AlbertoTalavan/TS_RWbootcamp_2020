**Basic Location:**  
Madrid SPAIN üá™üá∏  

**Programming Experience:**  
Along my life I have been working in some different fields (electronics, desktop support, ...), but my background is mostly in networking and security (snoc).
I have done some programming courses along my life in different languajes but I have never worked as a developer before.
Since, more or less, the last year I felt I was tired of not doing the thing I love the most and started my process of changing careers and focus on iOS and Swift...and I still loving it... so here I am taking my habilities as far as I can to achieve my dream job.  

**Goals:**  
Become a great iOS software engineer, and make a living doing the things I love the most! (create new things and try to solve problems).  

**Hoobies / Interests:**  
I love multiple things... some of them are:  
 - My dog (Hi there I¬¥m Le√≥n üê∂)
 - Programming (I am passionate about that) 
 - Sports 
 - Rolling skating 
 - Anime
 - Videogames 
 - Sci-fi movies 
 - read technical books 
 - TV wild life documentals 
 - and so much more...
