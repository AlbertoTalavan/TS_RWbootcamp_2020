"""
  Along my life I have been working in some different IT fields (electronics,
   desktop support, ...), but my background is mostly in security / networking (SNOC).
  I have done some programming courses along my life in different languajes but I
   have never worked as a developer before.
  Since, more or less, the last year I felt I was tired of not doing the "thing" I love
   the most and started my process of changing careers and focus on iOS development and
   Swift... and I still loving it... so here I am pushing my code skills to achieve
   my dreams.
