### Programming Experience:  
```Swift
public func MyExperience (as developer: Jobs, and other: Jobs) -> String {
"""
  Along my life I have been working in some different fields (electronics, desktop support, ...), but my background
    is mostly in networking and security (snoc).
  I have done some programming courses along my life in different languajes but I have never worked as a 
    developer before.
  Since, more or less, the last year I felt I was tired of not doing the thing I love the most and started my 
    process of changing careers and focus on iOS and Swift...and I still loving it... so here I am pushing 
    my code skills to achieve my dream job.
"""
}
```

var futureSelf = MyLife.shared

internal func MyGaols() -> String {

         Become a great iOS developer, and make a living doing the things 
         I love the most! (create apps to solve common life problems).  
   """)
}
```  

### Hoobies / Interests:
