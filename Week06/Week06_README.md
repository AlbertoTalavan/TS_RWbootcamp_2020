This week homework consists in create our own pokedex using a started project:
- it is mandatory 3 columns of cards in portrait and landscape (whatever the screensize is) using the first tab bar item
- for the second tab bar item we just have to show 1 card in portrait mode

>ToDo in the near future:
> - Refactoring code
> - do the same project using diffable data source and compositional layout
