# Week 04 (Monday 15 June to Sunday 21 June)

As the explanation of two projects was quite extensive for just one readme file, I have splitted it into two.

Here is a brief description of this Week 04Â´s homework tasks:

 
### Comparison Shopper 
We are given a crashing app and our mission is to solve a pair or three sneaky problems we will face.  

More info about the steps to resolve it:

### Compatibility
The task consists in finishing a very early state project fixing UI, giving it logic, etc. : 

More info about the inside app code at:

NT:->  Jay!, I also added some Unit Tests in this project ... please take a look at them and give me some feedback.
